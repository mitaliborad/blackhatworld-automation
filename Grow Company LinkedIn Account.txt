Topic: Hey BHW, I'm looking to grow a company LinkedIn account to around the 10K mark. Couple of points:

- Most team members are not on LinkedIn
- Don't really want to post weird, cringe content
- Need to make this happen within 2 months
- Cannot risk getting banned/nerfed at all as it is a legitimate company

Do you suggest:

- Social panel approach & buying straight through to 10K?
- Run follower ads (expensive but can pay) alongside this
- Influencer partnership
- Something else?

Additionally, if anyone has experience with (safe) social panels and can speak about their experience, I would be grateful.

Thanks!

Bumping/ Did you ever get any good insight on how to do this? I would also appreciate any insights.

Topic: Hey thanks for the bump! I actually did not, so if anyone is able to make a suggestion I would be grateful.

I have experimented with a panel which seems to be going ok so far, but there are a lot of drops which is disappointing.

Topic: I would run follower ads. It's the most expensive but fastest option. Also you need to get this done in two months time frame where the other methods you mentioned are too slow for this time frame.

Topic: I would say that the best way is to post a bunch of job offers and refresh them every week with new ones. Because by default in the end of the upload of the CV, it makes people follow the company page for updates.

Topic: I will not risk the standard of a company's official account with social panel offers.

I will run ads if I was in your shoes.

Not only followers ads, different types of ads (will split my budget)

This is a great technique. If you post a job offer in the Asian market, you will get to 1000s in a few days.

Topic: If you're part of a semi-large company with a few job vacancies available, what worked for us was running a few "We are hiring!" posts targeted at job seekers. It attracted a lot of university students & school leavers who were interested in keeping up-to-date with our available openings.

Follower ads were too expensive.
