Topic: You can. First, you need to do keyword research to identify low-difficulty keywords. Then, you need to target these KWs first and establish authority in that niche. Authority is everything now, so don't expect to get much traffic initially. Also, about setting up the structure of the blog, check out the silo structure. There are many good guides here on the forum. Good luck!

Topic: List all your skills, knowledge, and interests, then use tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, or Google Trends to check if they have good search volume and trending potential. Once you find a good niche, start sharing quality content.

Agree with you, and keywords must be low competition.

Topic: I think you should put keyword research stuff aside first. The first thing you should answer is: how long does it take for someone else to do the same by using AI? The more your niche difficult to succeed in by using AI, the more money it can make money for you. Therefore, you should be on the lookout to see if there is anything you're better than the average, so you can create content better than the average. Or maybe you can learn from people who know their stuff but don't have a blog and write them on your blog after getting their permissions. Anyway, good luck. Hope that works for you.

Topic: Okay so like whether you can make money from that niche really depends. Affiliate marketing could work if there are products people are already buying related to it. You get a commission on sales so that's cool. Selling your own stuff is harder but maybe you could create something unique. Services are another option think about what problems people in that niche have that you could solve. Basically research what's already out there see how others are monetizing and then figure out if you can do it better or differently.

Topic: You can absolutely do it if you have experience in one of these fields. And most importantly, whatever product or service you plan to do, choose a suitable business form with as little competition as possible.

Topic: You mean "the blogging niche" or just monetizing a blog in any niche? Either way you definately can. I agree with what the others said above on keyword research. Since you definately new stick with the easiest to rank for kws. When deciding on niches and kws keep this dandy mantra in mind

If the problem is severe and products are clear-Bring the niche near!
(low search volume is okay)

If the problem is low and all the prducts blow-Tell the niche to go!
(Need higher search volume)

Topic: do a research of the niche first, check how saturated is if is somoething that you are interested too so you don't give up easily and because is something you have knowledge about how it works and spend less time in researching and more in posting that is related to what you want sell, but mostly anything can be monetized.

Topic: You have to niche-down more nowadays. So pick an evergreen niche, say cooking, and then go deeper, baking at home, go even deeper, baking bread at home gluten free and so on. This niche does well on pinterest too, so add some nice AI images to have an extra traffic source aside from google.

Topic: Choosing a blog niche in 2025 starts with identifying your skills, interests, and expertise. Next, analyze the competition—if AI can easily replicate content in that niche, it might not be profitable. Use tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Google Trends to check search demand and monetization potential through affiliate marketing, digital products, or services.
