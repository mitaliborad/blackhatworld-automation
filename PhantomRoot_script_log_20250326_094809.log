2025-03-26 09:50:35,673 - DEBUG - Attempting to locate main post element with locator: ('xpath', '//div[@data-lb-id and contains(@data-lb-id, "post-")]')
2025-03-26 09:50:35,779 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Most people think SEO is just content, keywords, and backlinks. But it’s much more than that.

Quality content + Freshness

Keyword intent & Variations

Core Web Vitals & E-E-A-T

Semantic relevance & Internal links

Mobile-first & Voice search

Data-driven insights & Adapting to algorithms

Authority signals & Brand mentions

Video optimization & Structured data


For links, it’s not just about getting backlinks. A few things that actually work in today’s SEO:

Niche-Relevant Guest Posts: Not just "any" backlink, but one from a site in your industry.

Contextual Links: Links placed naturally inside content always perform better than sidebar/footer links.

Diversification: Guest posts, niche edits, HARO links, PR links. It’s all about balance.

Brand Mentions & Authority: Google tracks mentions even if they aren’t linked. Think PR and social signals.

Anchor Text Optimization: Overdoing exact match anchors is still a fast track to trouble.

SEO isn’t a one-time fix. Stay consistent, keep testing, and keep building. That’s how rankings last.
