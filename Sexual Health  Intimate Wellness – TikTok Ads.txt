Topic: Hi guys,

Does anyone know a method to advertise a sexual health brand on TikTok ads? We have been trying, but after a couple of days our ads get dissproved.. not because of ad copy / ad creative, but rather because they classify the products as "adult products"...

The company's branding is totally clean, no nudity at all, everything is minimalist and beautifully designed - so don't see the point...

Can anyone help? Cloaking? Other ideas?

Thanks!!

You will need to cloak your ads to get your ads approved

You might have better luck focusing on educational content, influencer partnerships, or driving traffic from other platforms first before running ads.
