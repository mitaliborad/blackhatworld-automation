Topic: I've been seeing so many accounts posting with Stake.com ad watermark on their videos, big known viral content niche accounts and random medium sized accounts.


Has anyone here by any chance been contacted by them (or know) and willing to share how much are they offering, and who were they contacted? did you reach to them or the other way around?

I just find it interesting cuz it seems like there's a wave of Gambling sites promoting on twitter this way.
