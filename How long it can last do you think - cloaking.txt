Topic: Hi everyone,

I'll start a blackhat campaign on Google Ads soon. The campaign is approved, I spent around $82 on it. But I didn't use cloaker or turned my white page to the actual and blackhat website. Therefore, I didn't encounter with any problem but didn't make use of the campaign, too.

There is a cutthroat competition in my niche. When I really get started, my competitors will mass report me. That's a truth that I was told about by someone who was in the niche for a long time. I assume, they didn't care much because it was my white page. It seemed like someone advertised in the niche by mistake.

I'm not going to use a sub-account of a MCC account or an aged Google Ads business in the beginning. It's an individual account that has completed advertiser verification, passed suspicious payments policy suspend twice.

I've never used cloaker so far. I'll go with Just Cloak It. I don't know how to use it but will figure it out. When I researched about cloaking on the forum a year ago, people would say "You should have a good campaign setup". I guess I have one, considering my setup was able to able without any issues.

I'm cutting to the chase, sorry. I'll add my white page link, and whatever is needed to the cloaker panel and will do the same with my black page. I'll make sure that it's going to block click fraud, bad traffic and of course, redirect Google bots to my white page. Is it going to be okay that way? How long do you think my campaign or account can last? It'd be desirable if it lasted 4-5 hours at least. I'm really new to this and kind of need to know how long it can last, so I can adjust the things.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for taking your time to read, any help is appreciated.

it really depends on a few factors man if you're running on an individual account without a solid history it's gonna be way more fragile cloaking can help but it's not a magic bullet google has improved a lot on detecting it so your setup matters a lot rotating domains keeping your white page super clean and making sure your black page isn't directly connected is a must if you get 4-5 hours you're already doing better than most but expect to burn accounts frequently some guys run aged accounts with warmed up ad spend history which helps a bit but it's still a game of cat and mouse

Thank you for your reply. It continued 2-3 hours and then stopped because couldn't charge my card. I tried to say that if it lasted when activated cloaker, 4-5 hours it'd be really desirable. I've not tried to advertise my blackhat page yet. The blackhat page is not done yet, when it is, it won't be connected or related with the white page in any way.

I don't know how many hours I should expect but I'll see.

Yeah if you got 2-3 hours even before linking the white and black page, then cloaking might help push it longer, but it’s still always a gamble. Some setups last days, some only a few hours. A big factor is how clean your ad account is and how aggressive your spend pattern looks. If you’re using a fresh account, Google might just be extra strict regardless of cloaking. Are you warming up accounts beforehand or running them fresh?

I spent around $82 on this one while I was adjusting things but I'll start to use the next ones as fresh. After some time with running the operation like that, I'll switch to agency accounts. If my competitors have some mercy on my fresh accounts for a while, everything will be fine lol.

Topic: Don't start with your main site

Experiment using a new domain that is almost the same as your money site, like a staging website

Cloaking is an art it takes time to learn it to the point you can do larger projects

Just my 2 cents hth

Thank you for your reply and for the last sentence, which helped me learn a new idiom, haha.

If you don’t mind, I’d like you to clarify your advice a bit more. What do you mean by "main site"? So far, I’ve only advertised my white page and haven’t used a cloaker; the blackhat website isn’t involved in the campaign either. The white page is like a blog website that contains a step-by-step guide on its homepage. It was approved, stayed active for 2-3 hours, and I spent some money on it.

The white page and the black one are nothing like each other. Still, the white page got me through campaign approval and allowed me to advertise for a while, which I couldn’t do before. If I activate the cloaker, I guess and hope that Google bots won’t see the blackhat website. So does it matter if they look similar? If the bots see my white page, I’m fine. But if something goes wrong, or if a mass report triggers a manual review and a real person takes a look at my actual blackhat website, I’m screwed.

Or are you pointing out a possibility that no cloaker is perfect and at some point it might let a bot into the blackhat website? If that happens, should the white and black ones not be so different? Is that your point?

Sorry for asking so many questions. For a beginner, some things aren’t so easy to understand. Thank you again.
