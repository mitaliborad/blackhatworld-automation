Topic: Hi Everyone,

Since last week, Journey by Mediavine have banned 500+ websites using AI content / AI image and listicles websites.

They even have made a form available for people to report AI websites directly :





Mediavine also want these websites to be blacklisted everywhere.

The mail sent by Mediavine : (I didn't received it )



Publishers were banned without notice. Just a 2 lines red message on their dashboard telling them that they can't use mediavine anymore.

Good luck everyone

Topic: Launching a form for the public to report AI sites is not the way to go since history of the web lets us know that people always abuse such systems.

They'll end up banning to many innocent sites or give their moderators more work to do.

Yes it will be a nightmare.

All of this started because of a big Cooking facebook group started to report AI sites in Bulk.

Now they will report competitors too.

Almost 90% of websites banned were about cooking/recipes. They will start targeting every niche like puns/riddle and all websites that are driving traffic from pinterest.

It's not easy to draw the line and identify which words were written by AI or by a human

Topic: Two of my AI sites are with MV and both are in the Keto niche. Only one of them is close to 100k UV/month to be accepted into Nitropay. Hopefully, before the Reddit mods of Mediavine bring down the ban hammer on me I can at least move one of my sites away from them without significantly denting my revenue stream.

Already had the IQ test - it's higher than yours. So try again.

Yup. Unless the 'detector' is good enough, then you produce false negatives. And you then need to improve what is doing the detecting.

Topic: I simply told her that any competitor can use the form to get any website banned because of AI and told her that we can see her website on her profile.

She blocked me straight away.

I think that I scared her without doing it on purpose but she still doesn't have the ability to fully understand the problem we will face.

Topic: the CEO privately sent an apology to one of their users because it turns out they didn't use AI. I believe they use deep seek and some other bullshit. They're trying to build a blacklist and burn all suspected ai sites from ever getting monetized even by the competition..and they will find themselves sued out the ass.

That is 100% true. Wait till someone finds a list of MV sites and builds a bot to report all of them. It's not rocket science.

Click to expand...
Pinterest has already caught a lot of heat for AI content, most of which is related to cooking and recipes. I think Pinterest is also on the way to taking some extreme measures.

I don't know if they'll get sued, but there will definitely be false positives. So many people will lose their monetization status because they made the tool public.

I mean, we've been gaming them for longer than MV existed. They knew the game and tried their best to upgrade their system to get rid of spam sites, but MV is not doing that and is relying on normal users to report sites. But making it public? That's another story for which I don't see any good ending...neither for the users nor for them.
