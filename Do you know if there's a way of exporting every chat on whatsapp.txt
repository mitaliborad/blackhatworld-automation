I've been trying to figure out the most efficient way to export ALL my WhatsApp chats at once into ZIP files. I know how to do individual chats, but I have hundreds of conversations I need to archive for a project.


What I know so far:

For exporting single chats into ZIP:


Open the individual chat
Tap the contact/group name at the top
Scroll down and select "Export chat"
Choose "Include media" if needed
Select an export method (email, drive, etc.)
This creates a ZIP file with the chat transcript and media (if selected)

But doing this hundreds of times manually would be incredibly tedious.


What I'm looking for:

Any hidden WhatsApp features that allow bulk export
Third-party tools that can do this safely
Potential API methods (I've looked into WhatsApp Business API but not sure if it works for my needs)
Scripts or automation methods that could help

I'm comfortable with technical solutions and willing to try different approaches. Has anyone here successfully exported their entire WhatsApp history into organized ZIP files? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!


Thanks in advance!
