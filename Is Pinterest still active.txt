Topic: if you know how to leverage it. A lot of people use it for affiliate marketing by sharing links in their pins, which can earn them commissions on sales. Businesses also promote their products. Influencers often collaborate with brands for sponsored content, too. it's a great way for bloggers and website owners to generate traffic.

Topic: In my opinion, Pinterest remains active with 450M+ monthly users, strong for visual content and product discovery. Popular for DIY, decor, fashion & recipes - especially with women 25-54.

Topic: Pinterest is still active and you can generate traffic from it. There are a couple of good Journey threads in the IM Journey section with a lot of detail on the successes and failures that people have been having over the past year.

The thing about Pinterest is you should be prepared to run multiple accounts, go slow, and automate whatever you can. If you upload about 5-10 images per day, every day, and have the patience to wait about 4-6 months, you'll generate a lot of impressions of your pins. If you follow best practices on pin design, you can achieve decent (not great, but decent) numbers of outbound clicks to your web site.

Either full or at least some form of semi-automation is key to keeping your sanity.
