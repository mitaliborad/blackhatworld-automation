2025-03-26 09:54:27,472 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I have been the last months developing a Spotify bot farm.
I used python + selenium
The bot is not just playing a song or playlist in a dumb way, I created an interface that has most of the operations that you can do in Spotify like create account, search artist, song, playlist, album... create playlists, change their names, add songs to a playlist, remove them, add songs and artists to favourites, pause the audio and restart it...

Every action is done in a way that resembles human behaviour, for example the search function writes char by char with a human like cadence and stops when the desired result appears on the Top Result.
It also uses one proxy for each account to have a different IP.

I also created a huge battery of unitests and integration tests so I can easily know when Spotify changes something and where to fix it.

I created 1 bs artist with TuneCore and I released an album, I am testing the first bot and it seems to be working fine.

The big challenge is how to generate profit over the costs of setting up everything.
Taking in account that the proxy service is around 1.6€ per month and that the distro for one artist is 23€/ year add then the electrical cost of running the 2 or 3 hours each day there is not much margin to operate.
I calculate that my bot needs to be giving around 40 streams per day to my artist to generate just enough to cover the costs.
One account listening to the same artist 40+ songs a day sounds suspicious to me.

Do you know how to overcome this issue?

For now I want to try:

- Go for the 40+ streams a day and see what happens, still alternate it with listening to other artists, change between listening playlists, albums, songs, put my songs on playlists mixed with other songs and overplay them.
- Try more than one account on the same proxy to make cost cheaper and see if it triggers a ban or not.
- Change the business model, instead of giving the views to my artists find artists who want to team up and go 50/50, that way I don´t have to worry about the cost of the distros and I can give views to different artists so my account is not suspicious.
- Buy proxies from the best paying countries so I maximize payments and need less views.
