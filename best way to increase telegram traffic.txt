Topic: Hi guys. I need to increase the traffic to my telegram private channel. What are your suggestions?
I already created some redirects on some keywords but how to make them index successfully in the global search?

Any suggestion is highly appreciated!

Topic: Simply create a TG group and grow it with target members.. And start posting your content in group and interested people's directly join your private channel.
Go for mass DMs on TG this also helps you to grow and get clients
Start shilling your project in other groups this take retention of other users and they directed towards your private group.

Note:
Doing all above stuff at the same time generates good results

Topic: You mentioned creating redirects on keywords, I'm assuming that means you're setting up short URLs or pages that point to your Telegram invite links in hopes that they'll rank in Google or Telegram's global search. Telegram's global search only indexes public channels, not redirects or private links, so your redirects need to rank on external search engines or social platforms.

yes sure .. if you want to target any community/ competitors group users then we will type a text and paste your social link with it and send to your target audience ,, this way your products/services get exposure and more and more people come to know about it..

and the other way to grow on Telegram is , scrapping users from one group and then add them in main group this is also a good way to grow on TG in short period.

If you have other question then let me know
